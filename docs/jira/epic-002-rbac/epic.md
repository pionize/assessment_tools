# EPIC-002: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Epic Information

**Epic ID:** EPIC-002  
**Epic Title:** Implement Role-Based Access Control for CMS  
**Epic Owner:** Technical Lead  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** To Do  

## Business Context

The Developer Assessment CMS will be used by different types of administrators with varying levels of responsibility and access needs. A proper Role-Based Access Control system ensures that users can only access functions and data appropriate to their role, improving security and operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- All authenticated users would have identical access to all CMS functions
- No way to restrict sensitive operations to senior administrators
- No granular control over who can modify assessments vs who can only view reports
- Risk of accidental or unauthorized changes by junior staff

**Desired State:**
- Clear role hierarchy with appropriate permissions
- Granular access control for different CMS functions
- Easy role assignment and management
- Audit trail showing what actions users performed
- Flexible system that can adapt to organizational needs

## Business Value

- **Security:** Limit access to sensitive functions based on user responsibility
- **Governance:** Clear accountability for who can make changes
- **Efficiency:** Users see only relevant functions, reducing confusion
- **Compliance:** Meet organizational requirements for access control
- **Scalability:** Support growing teams with different skill levels

## Role Definitions

### Super Admin
- **Purpose:** Complete system administration
- **Access:** All CMS functions including user management
- **Typical Users:** CTO, Technical Lead, Senior DevOps

### Assessment Manager
- **Purpose:** Manage assessments and challenges
- **Access:** CRUD assessments/challenges, view candidate submissions
- **Typical Users:** HR Managers, Senior Developers, Team Leads

### Reviewer
- **Purpose:** Review and score candidate submissions
- **Access:** View and evaluate submissions, generate reports
- **Typical Users:** Senior Developers, Technical Interviewers

### Analyst
- **Purpose:** Generate reports and analyze data
- **Access:** Read-only access to analytics and reporting
- **Typical Users:** HR Analysts, Recruiters, Data Analysts

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Role-based permission system prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] Users can only perform actions allowed by their role
- [ ] Role assignment is easy for Super Admins
- [ ] Permission changes take effect immediately
- [ ] All permission checks are logged for audit
- [ ] System performance is not significantly impacted by permission checks

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Role Definition and Management
- [ ] Four distinct roles defined with clear permission boundaries
- [ ] Super Admins can create, modify, and delete user accounts
- [ ] Super Admins can assign and change user roles
- [ ] Role changes are logged with timestamp and admin who made change
- [ ] Users cannot escalate their own privileges

### AC2: Permission Enforcement
- [ ] All CMS pages check user permissions before displaying content
- [ ] API endpoints validate user permissions before processing requests
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts return 403 Forbidden errors
- [ ] Navigation menus show only accessible functions
- [ ] Form buttons/actions are hidden if user lacks permission

### AC3: Assessment Management Permissions
- [ ] Only Super Admins and Assessment Managers can create/edit assessments
- [ ] Only Super Admins and Assessment Managers can create/edit challenges
- [ ] Reviewers and Analysts have read-only access to assessments
- [ ] Assessment deletion requires Super Admin privileges
- [ ] Challenge file management restricted to appropriate roles

### AC4: Submission Review Permissions
- [ ] Reviewers can view and score candidate submissions
- [ ] Reviewers can add comments and feedback to submissions
- [ ] Assessment Managers can override reviewer scores if needed
- [ ] Analysts can view submissions but cannot modify scores
- [ ] Super Admins have full access to all submission functions

### AC5: Reporting and Analytics Permissions
- [ ] All roles can generate basic reports relevant to their function
- [ ] Analysts have access to advanced analytics and data exports
- [ ] Super Admins can access all reporting functions
- [ ] Sensitive data (like individual candidate details) restricted appropriately
- [ ] Report generation activities are logged for audit

### AC6: User Interface Adaptations
- [ ] Dashboard shows role-appropriate widgets and shortcuts
- [ ] Navigation menu adapts to user's role permissions
- [ ] Page layouts hide/show elements based on permissions
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal existence of unauthorized resources
- [ ] Help text and documentation relevant to user's role

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
- User roles and permissions tables
- Role-permission mapping
- User-role assignments
- Permission audit logs

### Backend Components
- Permission validation middleware
- Role-based API endpoint protection
- User role management endpoints
- Audit logging system

### Frontend Components
- Permission context for React components
- Role-based component rendering
- Navigation menu adaptation
- Permission-aware form controls

## Permission Matrix

| Function | Super Admin | Assessment Manager | Reviewer | Analyst |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Manage Users | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Create/Edit Assessments | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Create/Edit Challenges | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Delete Assessments | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| View Submissions | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Score Submissions | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Override Scores | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Generate Reports | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Advanced Analytics | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Export Data | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| System Configuration | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| View Audit Logs | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

## Out of Scope

- Dynamic permission creation (permissions are predefined)
- Organizational hierarchy beyond roles
- Time-based access restrictions
- IP-based access controls (handled at infrastructure level)
- Integration with external identity providers (future enhancement)

## Dependencies

- **Blocked By:** EPIC-001 (Authentication system must be complete)
- **Enables:** EPIC-003 (Data Management), EPIC-004 (Reporting)

## Risks and Mitigation

**High Risk:**
- **Permission bypass vulnerabilities** → Comprehensive security testing and code review
- **Performance impact of permission checks** → Optimize queries and implement caching

**Medium Risk:**
- **Complex permission logic** → Use proven authorization libraries and patterns
- **Role hierarchy confusion** → Clear documentation and user training

**Low Risk:**
- **UI adaptation complexity** → Use conditional rendering patterns

## Timeline

**Estimated Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Target Completion:** [To be set during sprint planning]

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Security review completed with focus on authorization
- [ ] Role-based access tested for all user types
- [ ] Permission enforcement verified on all endpoints
- [ ] UI properly adapts to different user roles
- [ ] Performance impact assessed and acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated with role descriptions and permissions
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging and tested with different role accounts
