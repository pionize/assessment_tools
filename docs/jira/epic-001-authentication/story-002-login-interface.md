# STORY-002: Login Interface Implementation

## Story Information

**Story ID:** STORY-002  
**Epic:** EPIC-001 (CMS Authentication System)  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High  
**Assignee:** Frontend Developer  
**Status:** To Do  

## User Story

**As an** Admin User  
**I want** to log into the CMS using my credentials  
**So that** I can access administrative functions appropriate to my role

## Description

This story covers the creation of a secure, user-friendly login interface for the CMS. The interface should handle authentication, provide clear feedback, and integrate with the session management system.

The login system must be secure against common attacks while providing a smooth user experience for legitimate users.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Login Form Interface
- [ ] Clean, professional login page design consistent with platform branding
- [ ] Email and password input fields with appropriate labels
- [ ] Password field masks input characters
- [ ] "Remember Me" checkbox for extended sessions
- [ ] "Forgot Password" link prominently displayed
- [ ] Submit button clearly labeled as "Login" or "Sign In"
- [ ] Form validation provides real-time feedback
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design works on all device sizes

### AC2: Authentication Process
- [ ] Form submission validates credentials against admin_users table
- [ ] Successful login generates JWT token with appropriate expiration
- [ ] Failed login shows generic error message ("Invalid credentials")
- [ ] Account lockout after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes
- [ ] Locked accounts show appropriate message with unlock timeline
- [ ] Successful login redirects to intended page or dashboard
- [ ] Login attempts are logged for security monitoring

### AC3: Security Features
- [ ] CSRF protection on login form
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] Input sanitization prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Password strength requirements enforced
- [ ] Secure session token handling (httpOnly cookies)
- [ ] Login form uses HTTPS for all communication
- [ ] No sensitive information exposed in error messages

### AC4: First-Time Login Flow
- [ ] Users with temporary passwords prompted to change password
- [ ] Password change form enforces security requirements
- [ ] New password cannot match temporary password
- [ ] Password change success redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Failed password change shows specific error messages
- [ ] Password history prevents reuse of recent passwords

### AC5: User Experience Features
- [ ] Loading states shown during authentication process
- [ ] Clear error messages for various failure scenarios
- [ ] Auto-focus on email field when page loads
- [ ] Enter key submits form from any field
- [ ] Form remembers email address if "Remember Me" was checked
- [ ] Logout functionality clear and accessible
- [ ] Session timeout warnings before automatic logout

### AC6: Session Management Integration
- [ ] Successful login establishes secure session
- [ ] Session tokens stored securely in httpOnly cookies
- [ ] Session expiration based on "Remember Me" selection
- [ ] Inactive sessions timeout after configured period
- [ ] Multiple device login handling
- [ ] Logout invalidates session token
- [ ] Expired sessions redirect to login with message

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components
- Login page component with form validation
- Authentication context for state management
- Error message display component
- Loading state indicators
- Responsive layout components

### API Integration
- `POST /api/cms/auth/login` - Authenticate user credentials
- `POST /api/cms/auth/logout` - Invalidate session
- `POST /api/cms/auth/refresh` - Refresh session token
- `GET /api/cms/auth/me` - Get current user info

### Security Implementation
- JWT token generation and validation
- Rate limiting middleware
- CSRF token handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure cookie configuration

## Design Specifications

### Login Page Layout
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              CMS Login                    │
│                                          │
│  Email: [________________________]        │
│                                          │
│  Password: [____________________]         │
│                                          │
│  ☐ Remember Me    [Forgot Password?]    │
│                                          │
│           [    Login    ]                │
│                                          │
│  [Error messages appear here]            │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Error States
- Invalid credentials: "Invalid email or password"
- Account locked: "Account locked due to multiple failed attempts. Try again in X minutes."
- Network error: "Connection error. Please try again."
- Validation error: "Please enter a valid email address"

## Dependencies

- Admin user registration system (STORY-001)
- Session management system (STORY-003)
- Password reset functionality (STORY-004)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Login page accessible and functional
- [ ] Authentication working with proper security
- [ ] All error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Responsive design tested on multiple devices
- [ ] Security features implemented and tested
- [ ] Integration with session management working
- [ ] Unit tests for authentication logic
- [ ] UI tests for login flow
- [ ] Security testing completed
- [ ] Code review passed

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Valid Login:** Enter correct credentials → Redirected to dashboard → Session established
2. **Invalid Credentials:** Enter wrong password → Error message shown → Form stays on page
3. **Account Lockout:** 5 failed attempts → Account locked → Appropriate message displayed
4. **First-Time Login:** Temp password user logs in → Prompted to change password → Must set new password
5. **Remember Me:** Check remember me → Extended session → Login persists across browser sessions
6. **Mobile Login:** Access on mobile → Form displays correctly → Touch interactions work properly
7. **Session Timeout:** Inactive for configured time → Redirected to login → Message about session expiry

## Notes

- Consider implementing SSO integration in future iterations
- Login analytics could be valuable for understanding usage patterns
- Consider implementing progressive security measures (e.g., 2FA for super admins)
