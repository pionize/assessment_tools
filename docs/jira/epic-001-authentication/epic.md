# EPIC-001: CMS Authentication System

## Epic Information

**Epic ID:** EPIC-001  
**Epic Title:** Build Authentication System for Developer Assessment CMS  
**Epic Owner:** Technical Lead  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** To Do  

## Business Context

The Developer Assessment Platform currently allows candidates to take assessments but has no administrative interface. We need a secure Content Management System (CMS) that allows authorized personnel to manage assessments, challenges, and review candidate submissions.

Authentication is the foundation of the CMS - without proper authentication, we cannot secure administrative functions or implement role-based access control.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- No admin authentication system exists
- Assessment platform is candidate-facing only
- No way to manage assessments, challenges, or review submissions
- No administrative oversight or control

**Desired State:**
- Secure admin authentication system
- Multiple admin users can access CMS with proper credentials
- Session management with appropriate timeouts
- Integration ready for role-based access control
- Audit trail for admin activities

## Business Value

- **Security:** Protect administrative functions from unauthorized access
- **Scalability:** Support multiple admin users managing the platform
- **Compliance:** Provide audit trails for administrative actions
- **Efficiency:** Enable team-based management of assessments

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Admin users can securely log into CMS interface
- [ ] Session management prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] Failed login attempts are tracked and limited
- [ ] Admin activities are logged for audit purposes
- [ ] Authentication integrates with existing platform architecture
- [ ] Password policies enforce security standards

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Secure Admin Login
- [ ] CMS provides login interface with email and password fields
- [ ] Login credentials are validated against admin user database
- [ ] Successful login redirects to CMS dashboard
- [ ] Failed login shows appropriate error messages
- [ ] Account lockout after multiple failed attempts

### AC2: Session Management
- [ ] Authenticated sessions use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
- [ ] Session tokens are stored securely (httpOnly cookies)
- [ ] Expired sessions automatically redirect to login
- [ ] Users can manually logout and invalidate session
- [ ] Session activity extends session timeout

### AC3: Password Security
- [ ] Password requirements: minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- [ ] Passwords are hashed using bcrypt or similar strong hashing
- [ ] Password reset functionality via secure email link
- [ ] Password history prevents reuse of recent passwords
- [ ] Password strength indicator on change/reset forms

### AC4: Security Monitoring
- [ ] Failed login attempts are logged with IP address and timestamp
- [ ] Account lockout notifications sent to admin email
- [ ] Successful logins logged for audit purposes
- [ ] Unusual activity patterns trigger alerts
- [ ] IP-based restrictions available for high-security environments

### AC5: Integration Requirements
- [ ] Authentication API follows existing platform patterns
- [ ] User management integrates with existing database schema
- [ ] Authentication state management compatible with React frontend
- [ ] API endpoints secure and follow RESTful conventions
- [ ] Error handling provides appropriate feedback without exposing system details

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components
- Login page with form validation
- Authentication context for state management
- Protected route components
- Session timeout handling
- Password reset flow

### Backend Components
- User authentication API endpoints
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password hashing and verification
- Session management
- Audit logging system

### Database Schema
- Admin users table with credentials and metadata
- Login attempts tracking
- Session management
- Audit log storage

## Out of Scope

- Role-based permissions (covered in EPIC-002)
- Multi-factor authentication (future enhancement)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration (future enhancement)
- Social media login options (not required for admin system)

## Dependencies

- **Requires:** Database schema for admin users
- **Enables:** EPIC-002 (RBAC), EPIC-003 (Data Management), EPIC-004 (Reporting)

## Risks and Mitigation

**High Risk:**
- **Security vulnerabilities** → Comprehensive security review and testing
- **Session management complexity** → Use proven JWT libraries and patterns

**Medium Risk:**
- **Integration with existing platform** → Follow established patterns and APIs
- **Password reset email delivery** → Implement robust email service integration

**Low Risk:**
- **Frontend authentication flow** → Use existing React patterns from main platform

## Timeline

**Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Target Completion:** [To be set during sprint planning]

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Security review completed and passed
- [ ] Authentication flow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Integration testing with existing platform completed
- [ ] Documentation updated with authentication procedures
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment and tested
