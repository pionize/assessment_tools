# EPIC-003: Data Management and CRUD Operations

## Epic Information

**Epic ID:** EPIC-003  
**Epic Title:** Build Data Management System for Assessments, Challenges, and Candidates  
**Epic Owner:** Technical Lead  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** To Do  

## Business Context

The core functionality of the Developer Assessment CMS is to manage the data that drives the assessment platform. This includes creating and maintaining assessments, building various types of challenges (code, multiple choice, open-ended), managing candidate information, and overseeing submission data.

Currently, there's no administrative interface to manage this data - everything must be done directly in the database. This creates a bottleneck and increases the risk of errors.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- No administrative interface for data management
- Assessments and challenges must be created directly in database
- No way to modify or update existing content without technical expertise
- Difficult to maintain consistency across assessments
- No version control or change tracking for assessment content
- Risk of data corruption from manual database modifications

**Desired State:**
- User-friendly interfaces for all data management operations
- Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all entities
- Data validation and consistency checking
- Version control and audit trails for changes
- Bulk operations for efficiency
- Import/export capabilities for content management

## Business Value

- **Efficiency:** Non-technical staff can manage assessment content
- **Quality:** Consistent interfaces reduce errors and improve content quality
- **Scalability:** Easy to create and maintain large numbers of assessments
- **Flexibility:** Quick updates to assessments based on feedback
- **Governance:** Change tracking and version control for accountability

## Data Entities to Manage

### Assessments
- Assessment metadata (title, description, time limits, passing scores)
- Challenge assignments and ordering
- Assessment status and lifecycle management
- Assessment templates and duplication

### Challenges
- **Code Challenges:** Instructions, starter files, test cases, language settings
- **Multiple Choice:** Questions, options, correct answers, explanations
- **Open-ended:** Instructions, evaluation criteria, sample responses
- Challenge difficulty and tags for organization

### Candidates
- Candidate profiles and contact information
- Assessment history and progress tracking
- Notes and flags from reviewers
- Candidate status management

### Submissions
- View and manage candidate submissions
- Scoring and feedback management
- Submission status workflow
- Bulk operations for submission handling

- Audit trail implementation

### API Endpoints
- RESTful API for all data operations
- Bulk operation endpoints
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Data validation middleware
- Error handling and response formatting

### Frontend Components
- Form builders for different entity types
- Data tables with sorting, filtering, pagination
- Rich text editors for content creation
- File upload and management interfaces
- Drag-and-drop interfaces for ordering

### File Management
- Secure file upload and storage
- File type validation and size limits
- File organization and folder structure
- File versioning for code challenges
- Image handling for challenge content

## Data Flow Architecture

```
[CMS Interface] → [API Layer] → [Business Logic] → [Database]
       ↑                ↑              ↑            ↑
[Validation]    [Auth Check]   [Audit Log]  [Constraints]
```

## Out of Scope

- Real-time collaborative editing (future enhancement)
- Advanced workflow approval systems (basic approval only)
- Integration with external content management systems
- Automated challenge generation
- Machine learning-based content suggestions

## Dependencies

- **Blocked By:** EPIC-001 (Authentication), EPIC-002 (RBAC)
- **Enables:** EPIC-004 (Reporting system needs managed data)

## Risks and Mitigation

**High Risk:**
- **Data corruption during CRUD operations** → Comprehensive testing, transaction management, backups
- **Performance with large datasets** → Database optimization, pagination, caching

**Medium Risk:**
- **Complex file management** → Use proven file upload libraries, implement versioning
- **Data validation complexity** → Clear validation rules, user-friendly error messages

**Low Risk:**
- **UI complexity for different challenge types** → Modular component design

## Timeline

**Estimated Duration:** 6 weeks  
**Target Completion:** [To be set during sprint planning]

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All CRUD operations working for all entities
- [ ] Data validation preventing invalid entries
- [ ] Audit trails recording all changes
- [ ] Performance testing completed with large datasets
- [ ] File management system secure and functional
- [ ] Integration testing with existing assessment platform
